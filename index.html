  <h3>KPCB Challenge &#8729 January 31, 2018</h3>
    <p> Last summer in Seattle I had the pleasure of using Spin bikes. They transformed my commute from a muggy, uncomfortable walk into a breezy bike ride along Lake Union. To my excitement Spin also chose UCSD as its first partner school. In general, bike sharing is turning into a full-on frenzy, with Uber announcing plans to start a bike sharing service in San Francisco. </p>

<p id="heading">1. Magic factor</p>

<p>This is the part that took my breath away. To use, simply find a bike, scan its barcode with the Spin app, and watch it unlock. When you’re done, just park it and leave. You’re automatically charged for your trip at a rate of $1/hhr. I had never really seen a software-hardware interplay like this for something as innocuous as riding a bike. It’s very natural, and anyone with a smartphone can use it. 

The experience is a beautiful marriage of several crucial technologies - image recognition, connected smart locks, and distributed software.  

My favorite part of using the product is that all the complexity is abstracted away from you, the user. No worrying about where to park, where to charge (solar powered), or how to get the key. Just bike to where you want to go. </p>

<p id="heading">2. Market </p>

<p>There are many people on the fence about buying a bike, especially in college campuses and cities. This person has to decide whether to shell out hundreds of dollars for a bike, or only use other means of transportation, like walking (much slower) or driving (more expensive). Bike sharing is useful here because it doesn’t force the customer to commit. Going forward, there are opportunities to even beat the cost of a bike while still providing equal value, via subscriptions.

Globally, using a Spin bike is better for the environment than using a car. Additionally, Spin creates local jobs via its ground operations team (maintaining and locating bikes). 

Some points of caution when thinking about Spin’s business:
Spin has a very high direct cost for their supply of bikes. 
Similarly, for operations costs, a ground team has to be periodically locating misplaced bikes and fixing broken ones (Although I believe some optimizations can be made to lower operating costs, such as automatically deregistering broken bikes from the system so that the ops team can batch servicing at the end of the day).

Ultimately these cost concerns come down to volume and durability. If Spin can succeed in getting a high density of trips per bike, with a low failure rate, these costs will be mitigated in the long term. Spin should also continue to lock down exclusive campus deals and focus their supply on heavily saturated urban areas. </p>

<p id="heading">3. Unlocks a new economy </p>

<p>It’s interesting that Spin now has access to a broad network of short distance vehicles. They can leverage this to create new solutions, much like Uber did with UberEats via their driver network. 

One idea is that they can offer licenses, so that campus organizations or nearby businesses have bulk access. A unique benefit is that these bikes can be reabsorbed back into the common system as demand changes. Another option is to implement surge pricing, similar to what Uber does. As time passes, interesting analysis can come from their data on peak usage times, common destinations, etc. as well. </p>

<p>I think that Spin offers a great experience for short distance trips. I’m looking forward to using them at school and seeing what the future holds for the company.
